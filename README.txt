./train folder contains 12,500 cats images, and 12,500 dogs images
got from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/code

1. Pre-process the images - make sure that they are all the same size, convert them to greyscale, and normalize the pixel values.

2. Split the data into training and testing sets - create separate datasets for training the model, and for validating it.

3. Build the model - Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images.

4. Train the model - Input the training data and train the model using the selected optimizer.

5. Test the model - feed the testing set into the model and evaluate the results. 

6. Optimize the model - Tune the hyperparameters and perform validation until the model achieves the desired
